            when it comes to the messages the come within 
            them. Memes have gotten hate for the longest of 
            there creation however this has not stopped the 
            meme for a meme does not care what a human thinks 
            is impossible.

            <div>the definition of a meme is
            
            
an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means, especially imitation.
a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by Internet users.
                
            </div>The word meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, as an attempt to explain the way cultural information spreads; Internet memes are a subset of this general meme concept specific to the culture and environment of the Internet.
